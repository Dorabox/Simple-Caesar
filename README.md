# Simple-Caesar
a simple Caesar Cipher for me to practice dealing with for loops and other basic Python functions.

This Caesar Cipher will be just like the standard one, letting the user change the number of shifts that will be applied to the input.

Possible improvements in the future:
- Capability to encrypt strings with spaces:
- Add multiplication instead of just simple additon/subtraction:
-
